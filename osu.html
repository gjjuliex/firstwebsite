                <h3>Osu</h3>

                <p>Osu is a great rythm game that puts your arms to work more than you'd think. <br>
                You can download many different songs with different levels and play them alone <br>
                or even with your friends! I enjoy playing this game with friends competing <br>
                with each other head to head. It's one of my top favorite games to play because <br>
                I love rythm games and how challenging it can be. It's a fun game to play whether <br>
                I have three minutes or two hours of free time.</p>
