            <h3>League of Legends</h3>
            <p> League of Legends is a MOBA game and has about <i>80 million</i> active players a month. <br>
                League is probably my most favorite game to play. It can be super competitive or it can <br>
                be a great time passer with the different game modes that it offers. Through this game <br>
                I definitely have met
                great players and friends which is probably one of my favorite 
                feature.
                <br>
                <br>
            <p>One of my favorite things about League of Legends is the art style and the characters (aka champions) <br>
                that you can choose to play. Some of my favorite champions to play are Annie, Nami, Janna, and Vel Koz. <br>
                <i>BUT!</i><br> My all time favorite champions are Ahri, Lulu, and Lux! </p>
