            <h3>Animal Crossing</h3>

            <p>Animal crossing is a super cute game where you play as Mayor and you can<br>
                create a beautiful town with different villagers. I love this game because<br>
                I love games that I can makeover and customize things in! It's also co-op,<br>
                relaxing to play with friends, and you can spend time visiting each others town 
                and playing mini games!</p>

            <p> In Animal Crossing you also experience all four seasons! You can fish, catch bugs, swim, dig for fossils, and a lot more. <br> 
                When decorating, you can decorate outside, inside, and even the exterior of your house. Something I enjoy doing in this game <br>
                is talking and doing favors for your villagers, in return your friendship level goes up and sometimes you get neat items for
                completing favors!</p>
